# Gesture-controlled-robotic-arm
This project develops a Raspberry Piâ€“based gesture-controlled robotic arm that uses computer vision to track hand movements in real time. Detected gestures are translated into servo commands, enabling the robotic arm and hand to mimic human motion accurately and responsively.
